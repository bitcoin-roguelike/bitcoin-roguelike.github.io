Play my retro roguelike game and get some whale alerts on the way!
<br/>
<br/>
If you are playing on a PC:<br/>
  arrowkeys to move around<br/>
  a key = attack<br/>
  d key = potion<br/>
  click on the music button to mute the music<br/>
  <br/>
Or use a generic usb gamepad<br/>
D-pad to move around<br/>
B button = attack<br/>
A button = potion<br/>
Select button = mute music<br/>
Start button = start the game / restart the game<br/>
<br/>
Note! At startup, (one time only) you need to click or touch the "Start button" on screen to start the game<br/>
This is a compability limitation due to Safari on IOS requiring audio to be activated by click or touch<br/>
<br/>
Have fun! :)<br/>
